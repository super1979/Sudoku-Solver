# The project is for solving sudoku puzzles.
# It consists of 3 files: Logic.py, GUI.py and Console.py.
# Logic.py is used to solve the puzzle. 
# GUI.py allows the user to enter the puzzle using GUI. This is slower to use (since it requires user to enter the starting point of the puzzle cell by cell) but visually appealing.
# Console.py allows the user to enter the puzzle using CLI. This is faster to use (since it requires user to enter the starting point of the puzzle row by row) but there is no visual presentation
# User can download either GUI.py or Console.py depending on preferences.
# Both GUI.py and Console.py requires Logic.py.
# Console.py requires numpy.
# Console.py will print out the solution to solution.txt
# GUI.py requires tkinter.
# GUI.py will show the solution on the GUI. No printout of solution to a separate file.
# Code will not be updated.
